[-] population
[-] number of steps
[-]Allow the map to wrap around 
	[-] horizontal wrapping
	[-] vertical wrapping
[-] View class to handle different views.
	takes the model and displays it
	will now the width and height of the display
	will be given a  window of the model to display
	will determine the best screen real estate to assign to each cell
-zooming
	[-]zooming with keyboard
	- zoom in the center
	-zooming with mouse
			- a rectangle drawn by the mouse can be used to denote
				the new screen region
			- Minimum zoom level
	[x] how to handle inifnite maximum zoom level
		how do we handle the user continuing to zoom out.
		each pixel will now represent an entire region of the world
		therefore if > 50% of the region is covered by cells then the 
		region will be displayed
-better looking squares
-controls for running the simulation
	[-] ability to increase speed and decrease speed of steps.
		- x0.25, x0.5, x2, x4, x8
	[-] stop,start
	[-] restart
	- spawn new random configuration.
	- load a configuration file
			prompts the user for a filename.
				- if the file is not found, it will continue 
					with the current simulation
				- if the file is found, it will stop the current
					simulation, load the new configuration and then start
					running it.
			confiuration file will tell you:
				- width and height of the world
				- x and y coordinates of alive cells
			will create a new model
[x] show each cell as a faded region ( shades of gray )
	[-] the value in the cell will be 100 as a alive
		and 0 as dead, and then with decreasing gradients as
		steps since it was alive.
-colors for alive and dead cells
-different conditions
	- new types of cells, plant, animals, dead, alive
	- modifications on when a cell turns alive, or dead
-Adding interactiveness
	- user clicks on point in the map which causes a cell to turn alive
	- create a wave of alive cells
	- create a shape of alive cells
-Make it 3d
-Basic interface such as a menu screen
	- basic start, exit
- ability to manage the keyboard.
	- setting up custom hotkeys
	- better architecture for controls
